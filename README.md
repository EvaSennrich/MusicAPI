# MusicAPI-COP3530 --> Group Project Outline

**Project Members**: Eva Sennrich and Alex Pentakalos

**Data Structure to Use**: HashMap

**Project Title**: MusicAPI Search

**Project Description**: This project would make use of a music API to retrieve data about artists and their top music, genres, artist information, similar artists, and albums. It will use a HashMap data structure to efficiently store and retrieve the data. The user would be allowed to search for music and display the corresponding data from the HashMap. 

### Project objectives:
•	Students will learn how efficiently use an API and linear data structure such as HashMap’s.

•	Users would be able to search for artist and display the corresponding data from the HashMap.

### Project Features: 
•	**Data Retrieval**: The system will retrieve data from a music API such as Spotify or Last.fm and store it in a HashMap with the track or artist name as the key and the data as the value. The data could include information about the artist, Top 5 songs, genre, similar artists, or album.

•	**Search Functionality**: Users can search for artists and view the corresponding data from the HashMap, such as artist information, Top 5 songs, genre, similar artists, and albums.

•	**Similar artists**: When viewing data about an artist, the system should display a list of similar artists based on the data stored in the HashMap.

### Project Implementations: 
•	Project will use a music API such as Spotify, Shazam or Last.fm to retrieve data about artist’s music tracks, artist information, Top 5 songs, similar artists, and/or albums.

•	Store the retrieved data in a data structure such as a HashMap, where the artist’s name would be the key and their data as the value.

•	Implement search functionality that retrieves data from the HashMap and displays it on the console.
